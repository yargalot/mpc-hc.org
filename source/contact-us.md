# Contact us

Here is a list of ways to contact us. If you want to report a bug or submit a
patch, please also read our [bug reports page](https://trac.mpc-hc.org/wiki/How_to_Report_Issues)
for more information.


## Internet Relay Chat

MPC-HC has two official channels on the freenode IRC network. Developers with
commit rights have operator status, contributors have voice in the channels.

* [#mpc-hc @ freenode](irc://irc.freenode.net/mpc-hc/) is for user support and general questions.  [Webchat](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#mpc-hc)
* [#mpc-hc-dev @ freenode](irc://irc.freenode.net/mpc-hc-dev/) is strictly
  dedicated to MPC-HC development. This means development of MPC-HC itself. [Webchat](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#mpc-hc-dev)

### Rules

Please follow these simple rules when joining our channels.

1. Speak English, even if it's only a little don't be afraid to try.
2. Be cordial, the channel is a public space.
3. The channel is not a democracy, we reserve the right to remove person(s) for
   any reason deemed necessary.
4. Please do not antagonize anyone for any reason, this includes trolling or
   trying to "prove a point".
5. And last, but certainly not least, keep messages in the channel, do not
   message operators. Private discussion only benefits the two people having
   the conversation not everyone else in the channel.
