title: Translations moved to Transifex
---

From the beginning of the project, we always aimed to make MPC-HC accessible to as many people as possible through
a growing number of translations.

However, despite our efforts, translating MPC-HC was never easy and our somewhat
complex translation system probably scared away a number of translators willing to work with us.

We are happy to announce that we finally switched our translation system to use [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com),
a web-based translation platform. You can already find [our project page](https://www.transifex.com/mpc-hc/mpc-hc/)
on Transifex.com with some ongoing new translations.

If you want to contribute to a translation (either new or existing), all you have to do is sign up on Transifex, request
to join an existing team or start a new translation. More details are available on [our wiki](https://trac.mpc-hc.org/wiki/Translations).
If you have any question about translating MPC-HC, don't hesitate to [contact us](/contact-us/).
