Thanks to all of our users who voted for us, we are SourceForge's Project of the Month for November!

Feel free to check the related [blog post](https://sourceforge.net/blog/november-2014-community-choice-project-of-the-month-mpc-hc/),
accompanied with a small "interview".

Thanks everyone for their support! It gives us all strength to keep going!

P.S. Yeah, it's almost half of the month already, but you know, Real Life&trade;.
